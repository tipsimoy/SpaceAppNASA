### Simoy Project ###
- Simoy is a platform to crowd-source information, way to accurately measure
the air quality. It displays air-related symptoms.

- The crowd source information will be coming from a deployable unit. We also have a
way to crowd source information from the people of the community. The app will
indicate health effects corresponding to air quality of certain areas geolocated by
crowdsourcer. It will also give you advice on how youâ€™ll improve air quality.
The data collected by the app will generate a symptom map that will tell you the
areas most affected by poor air quality. It can also notify people of increasing
levels of pollution within a specific radius that can be affected. The unit can be
deployed to areas that are inaccessible by humans. It can also be installed in
houses for stationary monitoring.
